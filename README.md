# Capstone-Project
I built a neural machine translation system that is designed to translate German phrase into English phrases. I made use of an LSTM Sequential model in order to acheive this. I made use of the BLEU score metric in order to measure the goodness of the final translated text and I was able to obtain a 0.29 out of 1. The measured val_loss of the model is 1.546.

Due to exhorbitant training times, the model is being consistently improved.
